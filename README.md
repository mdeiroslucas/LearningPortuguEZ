# LearningPortuguEZ

<h3>When did you create this project?</h2>
I created this project when I was learning Angular and When I was doing the DIO Bootcamp (https://web.dio.me/home). I haven't finished it yet, nevertheless, I uploaded it because it's one of the challenges proposed for DIO.

This is just a simple project that I used to improve my skills and get the hang of Angular, but you can also learn some phrases in Portuguese. 

<h3>What did you use?</h3>
The tools that I used to build this project was: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
